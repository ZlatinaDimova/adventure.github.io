For this reason the length of the route may vary between 599 and over 700 km. The time required to go the distance depends on the choice of the type of transport; the meteorological conditions, the size of the group and its training, and other predictable and unpredictable factors as well.</p>
				<p>The average tourist crosses the route in about 20 days. Well prepared mountaineers could make it in 15-16 days, and the sportsmen take 10 days or less.Below are presented some example schedules for crossings on foot or by bike, which have been realized by groups of different size and demographic structure.</p>
				<p>All of the example schedules are optimized according to the rule of an overnight accommodation with the best possible conditions necessary for a recovery of the strengths.

				<h2>HISTORY</h2>
				<p>Kom Emine is a hard trek, but frequently chosen by tourists in the past and today too. Unfortunately the Lucky Man did not achieve to walk the route because of his untimely death. The first crossing of the route was realized in 1933 by the famous geographer and naturalist Pavel Dimitrov Deliradev. He was also known as “The Follower of Aleko”, 36 years after The Lucky Man’s murder.</p>
				<p>In 1933 Deliradev made the dream of Aleko Konstantinov come true. He and his companion Pavel Tsviatkov walked all the way from peak Kom to cape Emine, an itinerary which was considerably harder and more circular than it is today. Deliradev and Tsviatkov carried bag packs that weighed 20-30 kilograms, 10-12 hours per day. The weather during the whole trek was rainy and the temperatures were low. Back then, there used to be only 7 huts throughout the way, so they would spend most of the nights outdoors, covered with a ground sheet by a burning fire.</p>

				<h2>HUTS ALONG THE RIDGE OF BALKAN MOUNTAINS</h2>
				<p>Tourist huts in Bulgaria are unique not only with their warmth and hospitality, but with the way they are organized and financed, and with their legal status as well. Most of them, together with other tourist shelters, were built by volunteers with donations from Bulgarian tourists. Today they are managed directly by the BTS (Bulgarian Tourist Union) or are rented out to third parties.</p>
				<p>The huts in Bulgaria are built along the tourist routes. They are strategically located so that they are of greatest use to walking tourists. The huts are run by hut-holders who live in the mountain, in most of the cases, and who subsist on the tourist visits. The main duty of the hut-holder is to provide a dry warm shelter and food to the tourists, who often arrive tired, soaking-wet or cold. According to the regulations for hut managing in Bulgaria, hut-holders don’t have the right to refuse accommodation to a tourist.</p>
				<p>Bulgaria has 269 huts and 41 shelters in total; 91 of the total huts and 9 of the total shelters are situated in the Balkan; on the crest itself or nearby are situated 27 huts and 9 shelters.</p>
				<p>The huts in the Balkan can be distinguished by their hospitality and coziness. Even if they are not accessible by roads, even if they are not supplied with electricity and water is scarce, the hut-holders in The Balkan mountain manage to receive well the tourists and to provide them with the necessary conditions so they can get plenty of rest. It is of particular importance for the hikers of the tekking route Kom-Emine to be able to stay overnight in a warm and peaceful hut where they can receive nourishing food and have it on-site or stock up on more supplies.</p>
				<p>We present a full list of information on the contacts of the working and not working huts on the ridge of Western, Middle an Eastern Balkan.</p>
